/*******************************************************************************
 * montyhall - Simulates the "Monty Hall Problem", based on the old TV show 
 * "Let's Make A Deal". There are x number of doors (traditionally 3). Behind 
 * one is a shiny red sports car, and behind all the rest are lumps of coal. 
 * The player guesses which door is the one with the sports car behind it. 
 * Monty Hall then opens all the remaining doors except one. Because Monty Hall 
 * is like Santa Claus & knows everything, the doors he opens always reveal 
 * lumps of coal. The player must then decide whether to switch to the remaining
 * door or stay with their original choice. With only three doors, this seems 
 * like a true dilemma. The question is, is there a definitive strategy to 
 * maximize your chances of winning? The answer is yes; you should ALWAYS switch
 * doors. This is easily intuited when the number of doors is large. This 
 * program simulates a computer playing the game against itself an arbitrary 
 * number of times, once while following the strategy, and once while not, with
 * an arbitrary number of doors. It demonstrates that the probability of winning
 * when following the strategy is (x-1)/x while the probability of winning when
 * not following the strategy is merely 1/2.

 * Coded by Mike DeRuiter.
