Some programs are purely "academic exercises" while others serve modest utility.

Probably the most impressive program in the collection is a program in Python which implements an entire interpreted language as specified by an instructor in a course on programming languages. There is also a flashcard-studying app written in bash, & a script that adds users to the system in bulk based on a list of names. In C, there is a program that solves anagrams as well as a clever academic exercise solving a mathematical brain-teaser. 

## Languages Used

Currently, there are programs in C, C++, Java, Go, Python, Ruby, sh, & COBOL (Mike took a course).
