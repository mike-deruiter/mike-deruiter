## Various Small Programs by Mike DeRuiter

## Descripton

Collected here is an assortment of small programs written by Mike DeRuiter as he teaches himself how to program & how to use Git. You can reach Mike at michaelalanderuiter@gmail.com. 

Some programs are purely "academic exercises" while others serve modest utility. Mike has a special aptitude with scripting languages. Probably the most impressive program in the collection is a program in Python which implements an entire interpreted language as specified by an instructor in a course on programming languages. There is also a flashcard-studying app written in bash, & a script in Python that adds users to the system in bulk based on a list of names. There is also a program in C that solves anagrams. 

## Languages Used

Currently, there are programs in C, C++, Java, Go, Python, Ruby, sh, & COBOL (Mike took a course). Files w/o a suffix are either scripts or sample data for said scripts; inspecting the files will reveal what they are.
