## Various Small Programs by Mike DeRuiter

## Descripton

Collected here is an assortment of small programs written by Mike DeRuiter as he teaches himself how to program & how to use Git. You can reach Mike at michaelalanderuiter@gmail.com. 

Some programs are purely "academic exercises" while others serve modest utility. Mike studied to become a system administrator & has a special interest in scripting languages. Probably the most impressive program currently in the collection is a flashcard-studying app written entirely in the shell. Another script (in Python) adds users to the system in bulk from a list of real names. Mike is also adept with C, & wrote a program that solves anagrams, taking input either from files or piped in through stdin.

## Languages Used

Currently, there are programs in C, C++, Java, Go, Python, Ruby, sh, & COBOL (Mike took a course). Files w/o a suffix are either scripts or sample data for said scripts; inspecting the files will reveal what they are.
